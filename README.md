Either install the API (setup.sh) or Download the OS (Coming soon!)

# How to install via the API
Clone this repository to your Pi.( git clone https://github.com/ThatsFluke/PiCast/ ) Once done, in your terminal, make sure your in the PiCast directory. ( If not do cd PiCast ) And type chmod +x setup.sh . Then type ./setup.sh in your terminal and the setup will execute. Let it install the API and dependencies  You need to enable SSH on your Pi and reboot it for casting to work.

# How do I cast? 
You need the RaspiCast app on Android (As of right now only on Android) and then if it asks to setup SSH, Enter your IP for your pi ( After the setup of API is done it will display your IP, or do hostname -I in your terminal. ) Enter the user you use into the user box and type your password into the password box. Then tap OK. IF THE SSH SETUP DOES NOT POP-UP: Tap the three dots and tap SSH settings.

Now, Go on YouTube or Twitch( THE WEBSITE! ) and go on a video/stream. For YouTube, Click the Share button and tap Cast(Raspicast).
For Twitch, When your on the stream, copy the link and go into the RaspiCast app. Click the play button and paste your link into the box. Click Play.
