Either install the API (setup.sh) or Download the OS (Coming soon!)

# How to install via the API

( If not do cd PiCast ) And type chmod +x setup.sh . Then type ./setup.sh in your terminal and it will execute. Enjoy the API installed! You need to enable SSH on your Pi and restart for casting to work.

# How do I cast? 
You need the RaspiCast app on Android (As of right now only on Android) and then if it asks to setup SSH, Enter your IP for your pi ( After the setup of API is done it will display your IP, or do hostname -I in your terminal. ) Enter the user you use into the user box and type your password into the password box. Then tap OK. IF THE SSH SETUP DOES NOT POP-UP: Tap the three dots and tap SSH settings.

Now, Go on YouTube ( Only YouTube for now ) and go on a video. Click the Share button and tap Cast(Raspicast).

Enjoy!
